-> In bottomNav, replace the redundant code with a new component, and try to display the items using for loop with all data in an array.
-> Figuring our scroll feature for posts with multiple images
-> In PostCard.js the renderpost function is a mess, figure it out and clean it
-> In PostCard, inside the "allComment" component, the comments are just static, make them display using a loop or map function. this also goes for the replies
-> In reomve searched function of the "search" page, make sure the changes are made in local storage as well
-> In Search make sure only userId, img, and name is returned from backend instead of complete object
-> DeCentralize the follower count and Connection count. Loading completeing array will cause RAM overload.

NEXT TASK:

New to create a stack system for the 5 screens in Home Wrapper. Set name of the previous screen in a stack whenever user navigates to some other screen using the nav before below.
When user presses the system back, first check if the stack is empyt.
If yes, then move out of app (let the system run it's own back function)
If not, don't let system run the back operation, just navigate to the screen at the top of stack.



Make a schema diagram of all the objects. 
Add expamples/Demos of how objects like comments and requests work (especially when they are nested)
